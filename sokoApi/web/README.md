Introduction
Aspiring web developers often grapple with the complexities of backend technologies, seeking comprehensive guidance to navigate the intricacies of server-side scripting. This project endeavors to address this need by providing a detailed illustration tailored for web development students, focusing specifically on crafting a backend utilizing Node.js.

By demystifying the process of backend development, this project aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to embark confidently on their journey as proficient web developers.

Features
Here's a list of features for the Node.js backend SokoAPI project.

Routing: Implementing a robust routing system to handle incoming HTTP requests and direct them to the appropriate handlers. Middleware Integration: Utilizing middleware functions to execute tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling, enhancing the functionality and security of the backend.

Database Connectivity: Integrating with databases such as SQLite or PostgreSQL to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, enabling data storage and retrieval.

Authentication and Authorization: Implementing authentication mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth to secure endpoints and manage user access to resources.

Validation: Validating incoming data from client requests to ensure data integrity and prevent malicious inputs, enhancing the reliability of the application.

Error Handling: Implementing error-handling middleware to gracefully manage runtime errors and provide informative responses to clients, improving the user experience.

Logging: Incorporating logging mechanisms to record application events and errors, aiding in debugging and monitoring the backend's performance.

Testing: Writing comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to verify the functionality of the backend components and ensure code quality and reliability.

Documentation: Creating detailed documentation for API endpoints, middleware functions, and project structure, facilitating ease of understanding and future maintenance.

Security Measures: Implementing security best practices such as input validation, HTTPS encryption, and protection against common web vulnerabilities like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).

Scalability: Designing the backend architecture with scalability in mind, employing techniques such as load balancing and horizontal scaling to accommodate increasing user loads.

Deployment: Configuring deployment pipelines and deploying the backend to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku, ensuring accessibility and reliability of the application.

Installation
Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js: Download and install Node.js

Yarn: Install Yarn

Git: Download and iInstall Git

Visual Studio Code: Download and install VS Code

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the project:

Clone the repository

Navigate to the Directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. cd /path/to/desired/directory
Clone the Repository: Use the git clone command followed by the URL of the project repository.
git clone https://github.com/Pendiam/sokoApi.git
Verify cloning Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the cloned repository directory: cd sokoApi
Install Dependencies Run Yarn to install the dependencies specified in the package.json file.

yarn install
Verify Installation After installation is complete, verify that the dependencies are installed correctly by checking the node_modules. directory.

Usage
To use the SokoAPI backend in your development environment, follow these steps:

Configuration Ensure that you have configured the necessary environment variables such as database connection strings, API keys, and any other configuration required by the application. You may utilize a .env file for managing these variables. See .env example.

Starting the Server Run the following command to start the development server locally:

yarn dev
This command will launch the Node.js server, and by default, it will listen on port specified in APP_PORT environment variable.

Testing Endpoints After starting the server, you can test the API endpoints by sending HTTP requests to the appropriate routes. You can access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or Insomnia, or by integrating them into your frontend application.

Run the sample frontend using the Live Server extension.
